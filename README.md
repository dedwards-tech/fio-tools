# fio-tools

fio is a great tool for workload modeling and performance characterization.  In a vsphere world where workloads are generated by virtual machines, its a bit more tricky.  You either want to run multiple VM's with specific workloads, or you want to run one VM to stress a device to its limits.  Either way, it is tricky to geenrate fio config files for a suite of tests and various device combinations; specifically multiple direct io devices.

For example:

1. run a block sweep by varying block size and keeping other parameters such as queue depth and jobs the same.
2. run the same block sweep on 1, 2, 4, and 8 devices on a storage controller to determine boundaries of the storage controller and device set; such as HDD's versus SSD's
3. collate the ouptut into .csv or excel form for graphing and comparison between runs.

These are some scripts I use and evolve to help with my day to day work of pushing IO's to different storage configurations.

Once I get the scripts up here and versioned properly I will provide component descriptions.
